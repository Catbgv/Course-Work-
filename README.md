<h1>Text Adventure Game Development</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I have developed this game inspired in the Harry Potter series. I established 4 stages where the player will have to collect the three Deathly Hallows in order to win the game: The invisibility cloak, the elder wand and the resurrection stone. The game begins with the sorting hat event where the player will have to be placed in a house: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin based on their personal traits. Suddenly, Voldemort interrupts the Sorting event and Harry leads the way between the different stages.
The second stage is the Griffyndor Common Room to collect the invisibility cloak. In this stage I used the shuffle function in order to make the player guess the password to enter, which is Caput Draconis.
The third, Dumbledore's Office also has a password, but I made it a list where the player can pick an alternative in order to guess the correct password and collect the Elder wand.
The final stage is a battle with Voldemort. Here I used a for loop in order to make the attacks between the player and Voldermort fast and simultaneous to the story board. After defeating Voldemort, the player will earn the last Deathly Hallow.
At the end Dumbledore salutes the player, gives him or her the resurrection stone, says some last words and with that the player wins!
